# Spikonado Motion Core - Arduino Library

An Arduino Library for Spikonado Motion Core, a board that features an ESP32-S3 microcontroller, a 6-channel DC motor driver, and an integrated BNO086 IMU for precise motion and orientation data.<br>
It supports encoder feedback, enabling accurate position control. Motors can be driven at voltages up to 36V.

This board is perfect for robots requiring multiple motors.<br>
Simply wire your motors, connect the board to a PC, another microcontroller, or even your phone/tablet and use the ESP32-S3's versatile communication options like I2C, SPI, UART, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth to control your robot.
